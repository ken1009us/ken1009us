### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shu-Hao (Ken) Wu !

I am an incoming graduate student at UIUC, previously worked at Deloitte, Bank as an intern. And my last work is as a backend engineer in Ponddy Education Inc.

I plan to be a software engineer, backend engineer, or IT staff in the future. I can write some programming languages like Java and Python, and I participated in some practical projects during my last work.
