### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shu-Hao (Ken) Wu !

Having graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my most recent role was with physIQ as a Software Engineer.

An engineer with a sincere dedication to fostering positive change, I possess experience in coding across multiple languages such as Java, HTML, JavaScript, and Python. My involvement in practical projects at both work and school underscores my ability to apply these skills effectively.

Let's connect and create meaningful change together!
