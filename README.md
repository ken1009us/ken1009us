### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shu-Hao (Ken) Wu!

Having graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my most recent role was with physIQ as a Software Engineer.

As an engineer with a sincere dedication to fostering positive change, I have experience in coding across multiple languages such as Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, and HTML. My involvement in practical projects at work and school underscores my ability to apply these skills effectively.

Let's connect and create meaningful change together!
