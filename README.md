### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shu-Hao (Ken) Wu !

I'm a graduate student at UIUC, and my most recent employment isÂ with physIQÂ as an intern in SoftwareÂ Engineering.

In the future, I want to work as a software developer, backend engineer, full stack developerÂ or engineeringÂ staff. I have experience writing in a variety of computer languages, including Java, HTML, JavaScript, and Python, and I have taken part in a number of real-world projects at both my job and school.
