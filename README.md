### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shu-Hao (Ken) Wu !

I'm a graduate student at UIUC, my last work is as a backend engineering intern in Ponddy Education Inc.

I plan to be a software engineer, backend engineer, or IT staff in the future. I can write some programming languages like Java, HTML, JavaScript and Python, and I participated in various practical projects during my last work and the school.
